There are some two functions in simple_functions.py, ``factorial`` and ``fibonacci``.
Factorial gives the factorial (the "!" function) of the argument:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3,628,800

Fibonacci gives you all the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to the argument:

    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
