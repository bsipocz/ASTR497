This imports factorial from ``simple_functions`` which allows you to calculate the factorial of the argument.

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3628800

This creates a matrix of all fibonacci numbers up to the argument.

    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
