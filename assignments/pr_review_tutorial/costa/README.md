You will find in the file simple_functions.py that it contains two functions.
The first function, fibonacci, takes an integer as its input parameter, max. This input is the maximum value of a fibonacci sequence. Next, we have an array of integers called "values". This array starts with just two values: 0 and 1. The subsequent while loop takes the sum of the last two integers in the array. 
    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and this other part does something.  I forget why that I did it:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, its kind of your problem, not mine!
